Introducing RES Q Harmony, our cutting-edge alert system utilizing SRS computing, EDR, and magnetic reed switches. Designed to enhance emergency response, it swiftly fetches real-time accident data and relays precise location information via GPS to nearby hospitals and police stations. This seamless integration ensures rapid and effective assistance, potentially saving lives. Stay ahead with RES Q Harmony, revolutionizing emergency alerts for a safer community.

PROTOTYPE WORKING:Continuous monitoring of the compressed airbag box compartment is conducted through sensors. If the compartment opens, an alert message is triggered, signaling potential deployment or tampering. This system operates autonomously to ensure swift response in emergencies, promptly initiating calls to the nearest hospitals for immediate assistance.

## Problem statement 
In vehicular accidents, the timely detection and response to the deployment of airbags are critical for ensuring the safety and well-being of the occupants. However, conventional mechanisms for alerting emergency services and family members in the event of an accident may not always be efficient or reliable. There is a need for a proactive and automated system that can promptly notify relevant parties when an airbag deploys, along with the current location of the vehicle involved in the accident.
 
The severity of the problem statement lies in the critical moments following a vehicular accident, where timely detection and response to airbag deployment can mean the difference between life and death. Conventional alert mechanisms, such as manually contacting emergency services or family members, may not always be efficient or reliable, particularly in situations where occupants are incapacitated or unable to communicate. Without a proactive and automated system in place, there's a risk of delays in emergency response, which can result in further injury or even fatalities.
 
The problem statement underscores the urgent need for a proactive and automated system that can detect airbag deployment and promptly notify emergency services and relevant parties, including family members, while also providing accurate location information. Such a solution is vital for enhancing the safety and well-being of occupants involved in vehicular accidents.
